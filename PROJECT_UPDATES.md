- **Flexible Content**: Optional detailed content for selected projects
- **Professional Credibility**: Demonstrates thorough project documentation skills

## Usage

### Adding New Detailed Content
1. Add project entry to `projectContent` array in `projectContent.ts`
2. Set `hasDetailedContent: true` in the corresponding project in `projects.ts`
3. The detailed sections will automatically appear on the project page

### Project Page Structure
1. **Hero Section**: Project title and main image
2. **Basic Overview**: Original project description and technologies
3. **Detailed Content** (if available):
   - Project Overview
   - Problem Analysis & Solution
   - Technical Implementation
   - Development Process
   - Results & Insights
4. **Secondary Images**: Additional project screenshots
5. **More Projects**: Related project suggestions

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. Project page loads basic project data from `projects.ts`
2. If `hasDetailedContent` is true, loads detailed content from `projectContent.ts`
3. Renders appropriate sections based on available data
4. Maintains backward compatibility for projects without detailed content

### Performance Considerations
- Detailed content is only loaded when needed
- Modular structure allows for easy maintenance
- Responsive design ensures good performance on all devices

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Image Galleries**: Enhanced project image showcases
- **Interactive Elements**: Code snippets, live demos
- **Filtering**: Project filtering by category or technology
- **Search**: Project search functionality
- **Analytics**: Track which projects get the most engagement

### Content Management
- Consider moving to a headless CMS for easier content updates
- Add markdown support for richer content formatting
- Implement automated content validation

This update transforms the portfolio from a simple project showcase into a comprehensive professional case study platform, significantly enhancing the depth and quality of project presentations.
