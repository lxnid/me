# Building a Modern Portfolio with Astro

When I set out to rebuild my portfolio, I had clear goals in mind: **exceptional performance**, **beautiful animations**, and a **developer experience** that would make maintenance enjoyable. After exploring various options, Astro emerged as the perfect choice.

## Why Astro?

Astro's **island architecture** was the game-changer. Instead of shipping a massive JavaScript bundle for a mostly static site, Astro lets you:

- Ship zero JavaScript by default
- Hydrate only the components that need interactivity
- Use any UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte) where it makes sense

```typescript
// Only hydrate when the component is visible
<ProjectCard client:visible project={project} />

// Hydrate immediately for critical interactivity
<Navbar client:load />
```

## The Design Philosophy

I wanted something that felt **distinctively mine** while maintaining professional polish. The key decisions were:

1. **Dark-first design** with a carefully crafted light mode
2. **PP Neuemontreal** as the primary typeface for its geometric precision
3. **Subtle animations** that enhance without overwhelming
4. **Generous whitespace** to let content breathe

> Good design is invisible. It should guide the user naturally through the content without demanding attention.

## Performance Results

The final results exceeded my expectations:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Performance | 100 |
| Accessibility | 100 |
| Best Practices | 100 |
| SEO | 100 |

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. I'm planning to add:

- More interactive project showcases
- A blog section (you're reading it!)
- Case studies with detailed breakdowns
- Dark/light mode theming

Stay tuned for more updates as this portfolio evolves.
